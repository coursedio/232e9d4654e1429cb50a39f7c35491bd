00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:02.007
- Virtual agents combined several different

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:04.009
artificial intelligence concepts.

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.005
Your agent needs to understand language

4
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.005
then the system needs to respond

5
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.006
in a way that seems natural.

6
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.001
It's really difficult to build your own system

7
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.008
that interacts with people in a natural way.

8
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:20.000
One system might be terrific at understanding language,

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
another might be pretty good at generating texts.

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.001
But it's a real challenge to have a system

11
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:28.003
that does both well at the same time.

12
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:30.008
That's why I'd be very difficult for you to build

13
00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:33.004
your own virtual agent.

14
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:36.003
But on the upside, there are quite a few software companies

15
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:39.001
that sell their system as a service.

16
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.002
I have my computer here again,

17
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:43.007
and so let's see some of the top tools

18
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:48.000
for using virtual agents at your organization.

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.007
Virtual agents combine natural language processing,

20
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.007
natural language generation,

21
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:55.003
and automated decision making.

22
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.009
Let's look at one of the top virtual agents here.

23
00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:59.003
If we go to Microsoft's website,

24
00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:02.006
you can see that they have their own AI Chatbot.

25
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:04.008
Microsoft's Chatbot uses this gooey

26
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:06.009
to create a map of questions

27
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.002
and potential responses.

28
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.004
That means you don't have to use any coding

29
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.002
to create your own Chatbot.

30
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:16.004
It's really designed to be completely used as a service.

31
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:18.003
You can see here that you can buy the Chatbot

32
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:21.001
for a certain number of sessions.

33
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.008
Now, Microsoft also combines this Chatbot

34
00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:27.006
with their dynamics 365 Customer Service.

35
00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:29.009
So you can actually combine a virtual Chatbot

36
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.000
with customer service.

37
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.004
There's a flowchart style workflow that Microsoft

38
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:37.004
says it uses to create virtual agents quickly

39
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:40.002
and easily.

40
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:43.001
You can see that it connects up to a lot of other services

41
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:46.008
and the pricing is similar to just using the Chatbot.

42
00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:48.008
There's also another service from a company

43
00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:52.000
called Artificial Solutions.

44
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.007
They have a platform called Teneo.

45
00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:57.003
This platform uses a series of algorithms

46
00:01:57.003 --> 00:02:02.001
to do something that they call natural language interaction.

47
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:03.009
Much like Microsoft service,

48
00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.006
it doesn't really require a lot of software development

49
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:08.006
in a similar graphics tools that allow you

50
00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:11.004
to build your own conversations.

51
00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:14.008
There's another company called DigitalWorkforce.ai,

52
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:17.005
and they have a slightly different take than Microsoft

53
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:19.004
or Artificial Solutions.

54
00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:22.008
Instead of focusing on building out Chatbots,

55
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:26.006
this company wants you to hire their digital assistant.

56
00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:28.009
They have a nice little demonstration on their website

57
00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:33.007
of their top digital employee which they call Amelia.

58
00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:35.009
This demonstration assumes that you're an employee

59
00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.005
named John Smith,

60
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:39.001
so he can ask a simple question

61
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:42.003
like I need to reset my password.

62
00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:44.006
Then Amelia will ask for some more information.

63
00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:46.009
In this case, your employee ID.

64
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:50.002
We'll just put in an employee ID for John Smith here,

65
00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:54.001
and then she'll ask for a verification.

66
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:57.002
She'll pretty much act just like a human chat person,

67
00:02:57.002 --> 00:02:59.000
except this will all be automated

68
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.005
and in real time.

69
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:02.007
Because she has access to the backend data,

70
00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:06.000
she can also do some real time automated decision-making.

71
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.006
Here she resets your password.

72
00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:11.005
When you're done, you can just hit the reset button there

73
00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:13.007
and then Amelia will go right back

74
00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:15.009
to asking you other questions.

75
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:17.005
So this is kind of a nice little demonstration here

76
00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:19.009
of how you can hire a virtual Chatbot

77
00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:22.007
to do some simple administrative tasks.
