00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:04.003
- Natural language processing is a very popular concept

2
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.002
in artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.009
That's why there are so many tools available.

4
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.005
Some of these tools are just commercial products

5
00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:13.005
that you can buy from a software vendor,

6
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:15.002
but there are also open-source tools

7
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.007
that allow you to build your own system.

8
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:20.000
In the next two videos,

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.004
you'll see some of the most popular tools for NLP.

10
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:25.006
First, we'll talk about some of the toolkits

11
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.009
that you can use for natural language understanding.

12
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.009
Then you'll also see a very interesting paper

13
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.008
that evaluates which NLU system was the best

14
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:37.000
at understanding language.

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.003
In the next video, we'll look at some commercial

16
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:43.001
and open-source tools for natural language generation.

17
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.005
I have my trusty computer ready here,

18
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:49.005
so let's start looking at some of these AI tools.

19
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.006
When you're starting out with natural language processing,

20
00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:53.006
a good place to start is using something called

21
00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.007
the Natural Language Toolkit.

22
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.002
Let's just scroll down here and go to the website

23
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:01.006
for the Natural Language Toolkit.

24
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:03.009
This toolkit is written in Python.

25
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.007
It's freely available and simple to install.

26
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:08.009
You just have to know a little bit about Python.

27
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.001
All you have to do is import the NLTK Python library

28
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:14.007
and the data.

29
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.005
If you scroll back up here to the top,

30
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:18.004
there's a link to the FAQ.

31
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:20.008
It will give you some information about the license.

32
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:25.001
The NLTK uses an open-source Apache license.

33
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.009
That means that you could use it freely to learn,

34
00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.004
and you could also use it in your products.

35
00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:31.007
It uses both versions of Python,

36
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:35.001
but you'll probably want to use Python 3.4 going forward.

37
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.000
If you end up using NLTK,

38
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.005
you might want to get a copy of their book.

39
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:41.004
It has a lot of information about NLTK,

40
00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:45.000
plus gives you some code samples that they call recipes.

41
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So if we go back here,

42
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.008
you can see some instructions on how to install.

43
00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:51.000
It's a little bit easier to install on Mac and Linux

44
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.004
than it is on Windows.

45
00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:56.000
In Windows, you just have to install this binary for Python.

46
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.006
You also need to install the data

47
00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:00.002
to make sure that the library works correctly.

48
00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:02.002
So that's pretty easy here.

49
00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:06.002
There's also some instructions for installing the data.

50
00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:08.008
So Natural Language Toolkit is a great tool to start

51
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:12.002
learning about natural language processing or NLP.

52
00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:14.002
There's another great resource available

53
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:17.009
for natural language understanding, or NLU.

54
00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:19.000
If you go to Google Scholar,

55
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.003
you can see there's a paper that's freely available

56
00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:24.004
called "A Comparison and Critique of

57
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:26.009
Natural Language Understanding Tools".

58
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.000
This paper will give you an overview

59
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.001
of various natural language understanding tools.

60
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:33.009
I downloaded the paper here.

61
00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.001
Just double click it to open.

62
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.007
This is written by two professors in Italy.

63
00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:41.002
What they did was that they went through and did a survey

64
00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:45.005
of many of the top natural language understanding platforms.

65
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:48.001
They wanted to see which platform understood

66
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.006
the intent of the language.

67
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:53.003
They wanted to see which one worked best.

68
00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:57.000
They tested Google's Dialogueflow, Facebook's Wit.ai,

69
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Microsoft's LUIS, IBM's Watson Conversation,

70
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.009
Amazon Lex, and Recast.ai.

71
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.005
Each of these tools are about understanding language,

72
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:09.000
and you can see that they went through

73
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.001
each one at a time here and evaluated them

74
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:14.006
to see how well they understood language.

75
00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:17.001
So if you scroll down to the very end here,

76
00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:18.007
you can see their conclusion,

77
00:03:18.007 --> 00:03:20.008
where they talk about which one of these tools

78
00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:25.000
performs the best at understanding the intent of language.

79
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.009
You can see that for this study,

80
00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.002
they found that Watson was the platform

81
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:32.004
that understood the intent of language best.

82
00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:35.001
This paper came out in 2018,

83
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:37.001
so the results might be different today.

84
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:38.005
But if you're thinking about using

85
00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:40.001
natural language understanding,

86
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:41.006
this paper shows a great way

87
00:03:41.006 --> 00:03:43.009
to evaluate these different tools.

88
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:45.005
You can use some of their suggestions

89
00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:49.002
to test these different platforms for your own organization.
