00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:03.004
- Imagine that you're flying to a friend's graduation party.

2
00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:06.002
You're a loyal customer, so you fly the same airline.

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.008
When you arrive at the airport, you start to worry.

4
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.005
You see people gathering in front of monitors.

5
00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:13.005
It turns out that your flight has been canceled

6
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:15.004
due to bad weather.

7
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:18.004
Almost immediately, you get a text on your phone.

8
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.001
It turns out that you've been booked on the next flight.

9
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.003
You also get a smart code with a coupon for a restaurant.

10
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:27.003
Now, all of this is happening instantaneously.

11
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.005
It had very little human intervention,

12
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:31.002
and it's all because your airline

13
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:34.007
uses something called automated decision-making.

14
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:37.006
Remember that AI systems do well when they have access

15
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:40.001
to tremendous amounts of data.

16
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.009
Using that data, the airline can build a system

17
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.000
that makes instant decisions.

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.004
It can do this in a fraction of the time

19
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.003
that it would take a human customer service agent.

20
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:51.009
The automated decision-making system

21
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.005
probably evaluated your customer loyalty.

22
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.006
That way it could figure out who to book first

23
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.000
on the next flight.

24
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.004
Then it did some probability analysis

25
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:01.009
to determine the likelihood

26
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.004
your new flight was departing on time.

27
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.002
For that, it might use data sources

28
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:08.001
from the National Weather Service.

29
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.005
It might even look at historical trends

30
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:13.003
of similar flights from the same airport.

31
00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:16.006
Finally, it created coupons based on the probability

32
00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:19.003
that you'd get something to eat before your next flight.

33
00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:22.006
It might get this data from your airline credit card.

34
00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:27.007
This AI system uses a combination of statistical techniques.

35
00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:31.007
One of the most important is real-time data gathering.

36
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:34.007
The system uses real-time data about the weather,

37
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:38.007
the airport, and the flight status of arriving airplanes.

38
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:41.008
It also takes into account whether this is your home city,

39
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:44.006
or if you're connecting to a different flight.

40
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:47.002
The system might also use trend analysis.

41
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:49.006
It considers questions like how long does it take

42
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:51.002
for the airport to clear out?

43
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.003
How many people go to the restaurants?

44
00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:55.000
How often do you travel?

45
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.003
And how will this impact your future buying decisions?

46
00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:01.002
This system uses both data and trend analysis

47
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.005
to forecast different outcomes.

48
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:05.001
What's the likelihood that you'll arrive

49
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.001
close to your original arrival time?

50
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:09.006
What's the likelihood that your flight will take off

51
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:11.007
without any further delay?

52
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:15.007
Remember that the AI system sees this as a data challenge.

53
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:17.002
Then it looks for patterns

54
00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.005
so it can better predict future outcomes.

55
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:23.006
In many ways, that makes the system uniquely qualified

56
00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:25.005
to make real-time decisions.

57
00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:28.004
A human customer service agent might be friendlier,

58
00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:30.007
but it would be nearly impossible for them

59
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:33.008
to weigh all these different statistical outcomes.

60
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:36.004
So it would be harder for them to come up with a solution

61
00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:40.001
that has the highest probability of success.

62
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:43.001
AI systems can also do automated decision-making

63
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:47.000
to help solve all kinds of business logistics challenges.

64
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.004
It's not just airlines that benefit

65
00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:52.004
from this type of real-time decision making.
