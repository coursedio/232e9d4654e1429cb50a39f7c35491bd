00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.005
- A few years ago, I was working for an organization

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:06.008
that handled tremendous amounts of credit card data.

3
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:08.008
Their entire business centered

4
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.002
around analyzing customer purchases

5
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:15.000
and recommending promotions based on their interests.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.002
So when a customer logged in to pay their bill,

7
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.007
they had the option of adding a digital coupon

8
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:21.000
to their credit card.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.002
So it might be a coupon for a restaurant.

10
00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.000
If a customer adds the coupon,

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.002
they'll automatically get a small discount

12
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.003
when they try out the restaurant.

13
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:30.004
So if you think about it,

14
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:33.007
this company is analyzing massive amounts of data.

15
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.008
Each customer might have hundreds

16
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:38.001
of transactions every month.

17
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:39.006
The major credit card companies

18
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.001
have tens of millions of customers.

19
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.003
So that's billions of transactions

20
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:47.003
and several petabytes of data.

21
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:49.007
This type of processing wouldn't be practical

22
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.005
with just one system.

23
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.009
So this business created an artificial neural network

24
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.003
to analyze all this data.

25
00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.001
And remember, the data on its own

26
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.009
isn't necessarily valuable.

27
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:04.003
It's just a list of mundane transactions attached

28
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:06.002
to an anonymous customer ID.

29
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:10.005
What is valuable is the analysis that the company provides.

30
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:11.004
In this case,

31
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:14.003
the credit card companies wanted a way to accurately predict

32
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:16.009
where customers would use their credit cards.

33
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.002
It's easy to see where a customer has been.

34
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:20.006
The real challenge is

35
00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:24.004
to predict new places the customer might go.

36
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:26.000
That means that the credit card company

37
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.003
could sell promotions to other businesses,

38
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:31.006
and businesses would be happy to pay for these promotions

39
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:34.001
because they could get new customers.

40
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:37.003
Now, remember, there's two main types of machine learning.

41
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:39.005
There's supervised machine learning

42
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:42.001
and unsupervised machine learning.

43
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.009
Supervised machine learning classifies data

44
00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.003
based on labels that humans create.

45
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:50.006
So you come up with different classifications,

46
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:53.007
and then the machine sorts them into groups.

47
00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:55.007
With unsupervised machine learning,

48
00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:58.003
the AI system creates its own groups.

49
00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:00.007
Here, it clusters data together

50
00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:03.006
based on very sophisticated patterns.

51
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:06.004
This credit card processing company actually used

52
00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:11.002
a combination of both unsupervised and supervised learning.

53
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:13.008
The first thing it did was allow the machine

54
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:16.003
to create clusters of different customers

55
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:19.002
who had very similar spending habits.

56
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:21.005
So as a customer, you would be grouped together

57
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:24.005
with people who spend money in similar ways.

58
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:27.003
Then it looked for crossover businesses.

59
00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:28.009
So let's say you used your credit card

60
00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.008
to go to Mexican food restaurants, buy wine,

61
00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:34.000
and visit Arizona.

62
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.002
The machine would cluster you together with someone

63
00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:39.008
who also buys wine and travels to Arizona.

64
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.003
Then it would send you promotions

65
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:44.001
for a local Mexican food restaurant.

66
00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:45.007
Once the machine learning algorithm

67
00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:48.002
clustered customers into these groups,

68
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:51.008
the artificial neural network would then classify them

69
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:54.005
with different customer labels.

70
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:57.001
So in this case, they created labels for customers

71
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.005
who are more flexible and open to new experiences.

72
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:02.003
Then the other label were customers

73
00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:06.002
who tended not to like new foods or restaurants.

74
00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:07.008
This artificial neural network

75
00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:10.004
using machine learning algorithms was able

76
00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:14.000
to find new businesses that these customers might like.

77
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.008
Then they classified these customers into people

78
00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:19.005
who were more likely to try new food.

79
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:21.009
By doing this, they were able to micro-target

80
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:25.001
the very best customers for these promotions.
