00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.006
- Automated decision making systems can do a lot of things

2
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.004
better than human customer service agents.

3
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.006
They can simply look at more data sources

4
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:12.002
and make more decisions in a shorter period of time.

5
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.000
But if you're thinking about using these tools,

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.006
you should actually think about it as supplementing agents

7
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.008
instead of replacing them.

8
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.006
In your organization there are generally two types

9
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:24.005
of decisions that you need to make.

10
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:29.006
There are analytical decisions and intuitive decisions.

11
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:32.007
Analytical decisions follow predictable patterns.

12
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:36.007
They usually involve a lot of data and statistical analysis.

13
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:39.009
So with a canceled flight, an AI system can use data

14
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:42.003
about the airport, the flight schedule,

15
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:44.003
and even the weather service.

16
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:46.005
Then it makes an analytical decision

17
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:49.002
about how to rebook your flight.

18
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:51.007
But sometimes businesses are forced to make decisions

19
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:54.009
about things that have never happened.

20
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:56.009
So if you think about March 2020,

21
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.006
many of the airlines were forced to shut down,

22
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:03.005
not because of weather, but because of a global pandemic.

23
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.006
Airlines had never had to shut down before

24
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:09.008
because of a pandemic, so there was no preexisting data.

25
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:13.004
As a result, many of the AI systems didn't work well

26
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:14.009
in the crisis.

27
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.005
Instead, many of the problems had to be fixed

28
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:19.009
by human customer service agents.

29
00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.002
This was a much slower and much more complicated,

30
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:26.001
intuitive decision making process.

31
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.000
That's because each of these agents

32
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.009
had used their own human intuition to solve problems.

33
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.007
So you should think of it this way,

34
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:38.009
AI systems do extremely well when there's little uncertainty

35
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.002
and the system can rely on historical data.

36
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.006
Human customer service agents do well

37
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:47.007
when the problem is something that hasn't happened before.

38
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:52.001
Then the agent has to think intuitively about a solution.

39
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:53.003
So if you're thinking about using

40
00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:55.009
AI automated decision making systems,

41
00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.005
you should balance the two ways that your organization

42
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:00.004
has to make decisions.

43
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:02.004
If there's a lot of unpredictability,

44
00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:05.007
then you'd be better served by giving human decision makers,

45
00:02:05.007 --> 00:02:07.002
the tools that they need.

46
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.009
They can use these tools to address challenges

47
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.008
much more quickly.

48
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.000
On the other hand, a more analytical

49
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.006
AI automated decision making system

50
00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:19.005
will do well if you have a lot of historical data.

51
00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:23.002
Then you can focus on a system that reacts quickly.

52
00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:26.006
So a parcel delivery service like UPS or FedEx

53
00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:28.008
could really benefit from an automated

54
00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:30.004
decision making system.

55
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:33.002
They have massive amounts of data on delivery times

56
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:36.000
and perhaps even alternative routes.

57
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.001
But if your business is in retail or hospitality,

58
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:40.003
then you might be better off

59
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:44.007
having some more intuitive human customer service agents.
