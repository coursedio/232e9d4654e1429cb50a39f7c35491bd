00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:03.008
- In 2016, the famous computer scientist,

2
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:05.001
Geoffrey Hinton said,

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.002
"It's quite obvious

4
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:09.003
that we should stop training radiologists."

5
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:11.003
He believed that machine learning systems

6
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.003
could make better decisions when looking at x-rays.

7
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:17.008
He thought that these systems would quickly overtake humans,

8
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:21.001
so there was no need to train radiologists.

9
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.008
Now, we've seen that these systems can run in a few ways.

10
00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:25.005
Through supervised machine learning

11
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:28.005
or unsupervised machine learning.

12
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.001
For supervised machine learning,

13
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.007
you teach the system to see the pattern.

14
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:34.006
So you might have radiologists

15
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.006
gather thousands of x-rays

16
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:39.001
where a patient needed back surgery.

17
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.000
This would be your training set.

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.004
Then you'd feed it into the machine learning algorithm.

19
00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:46.003
Once the system was well trained,

20
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:48.007
then you can have it look through new x-rays.

21
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.000
So it would try to match the patterns.

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.005
Then it would make a decision

23
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:55.008
about whether this patient needs back surgery.

24
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:58.004
This kind of automated decision-making system

25
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.005
would make split-second decisions

26
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.006
based on the machine learning algorithm's

27
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:05.003
advanced pattern matching.

28
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:06.009
The advantages of this type of system

29
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.008
is it can make instantaneous decisions.

30
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:13.001
It might even be included as part of the x-ray machine.

31
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.001
Also, if you believe professor Hinton,

32
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.005
it might be much more accurate.

33
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:19.005
The machine could see tiny abnormalities

34
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.005
that it would be difficult or impossible

35
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:25.003
for a human radiologist to identify.

36
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:28.000
You could also use unsupervised machine learning.

37
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.008
Here you would let the machine decide

38
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:33.000
how to cluster together different x-rays.

39
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.006
Then a technician could look at these clusters

40
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:38.007
and try to identify any abnormalities.

41
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:40.002
If you use this approach,

42
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:42.000
the machine learning algorithm

43
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.006
might find diseases or disorders

44
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:47.002
that haven't even been discovered.

45
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:48.006
But most of the work in this area

46
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:51.003
has been using supervised machine learning.

47
00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:53.008
AI researchers have a list of disorders,

48
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:55.003
and then they create training sets

49
00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:58.002
collected by human radiologists.

50
00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:00.009
The system then uses automated decision-making

51
00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.006
to come up with a recommendation.

52
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:06.002
So what do you think of professor Hinton's idea?

53
00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:09.004
Would you prefer to have your x-ray viewed by a radiologist

54
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:12.000
or by a machine learning algorithm?

55
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.008
If you think about it,

56
00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:16.001
there's a downside to replacing human radiologists

57
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:19.000
with an automated decision-making system.

58
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.009
Supervised machine learning systems

59
00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:25.005
require human experts to create the initial training set.

60
00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:27.005
If you stop training radiologists,

61
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:30.007
then there won't be that level of human expertise

62
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:32.008
to help train the system.

63
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:34.009
This might be fine if there are no new diseases

64
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:35.009
or disorders,

65
00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:39.001
but what if the machine finds a new abnormality?

66
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:41.004
Remember that supervised machine learning systems

67
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:45.001
have trouble when they see something completely new.

68
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.004
You could also use unsupervised machine learning,

69
00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:48.008
but then there's the risk

70
00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:50.008
that if the system clusters together

71
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:52.003
different abnormalities,

72
00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:54.006
there won't be an experienced radiologist

73
00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.008
to identify the disease.

74
00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:58.006
So you can see that there are a lot of different ways

75
00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:01.009
to use machine learning for automated decision making.

76
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.000
The key is figuring out

77
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.009
how much control you want to leave in the hands of the system.
