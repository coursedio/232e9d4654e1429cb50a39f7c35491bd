00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.009
- Are you one of those people who remembers someone's face

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.009
better than you remember their name?

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.001
That's not that unusual.

4
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.002
In fact, from a young age, most humans are excellent

5
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:10.009
at tracking faces.

6
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.000
Of course, each person's face is a little bit different.

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.004
Eyes, nose, lips, and ears, all vary slightly

8
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.000
from person to person,

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.001
and these differences can be turned into data.

10
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:26.000
You can calculate the exact distance of all of your features

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.007
and come up with a series of numbers.

12
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.007
Generally, we call this biometric data.

13
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:34.006
These are the distinct, measurable characteristics

14
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:37.005
that are used to identify individuals.

15
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.009
This data can measure your fingerprints, your DNA,

16
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.007
or even the sound of your voice.

17
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:45.005
Then you can gather this data

18
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:49.001
and machine learning algorithms will look for patterns.

19
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.005
So imagine that you call up a customer service line,

20
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.001
but you're not really getting the help you need.

21
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.007
As your frustration grows your voice sounds more strange.

22
00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.005
Your breathing could become irregular

23
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.008
and artificial intelligence agents

24
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:04.008
would then warn a supervisor

25
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:07.001
that there's an unhappy customer.

26
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:10.004
An artificial intelligence system looks at biometrics,

27
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:13.001
like it would any other type of data.

28
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:16.007
It would compare your voice with hundreds of thousands

29
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:18.007
of other conversations.

30
00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:21.008
Than an engineer might use supervised machine learning

31
00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:26.007
to train the system to identify angry customers.

32
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:29.002
You might not think of your face, your fingerprints

33
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:32.008
or your voice as data, but to a machine learning system

34
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:36.002
it's just numbers and probability.

35
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:38.007
Widespread facial recognition is one

36
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:42.004
of the more controversial ways of using biometrics.

37
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:45.008
Remember that machine learning systems operate best

38
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:48.004
when they're dealing with massive amounts of data.

39
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:50.009
So that means that these systems can easily look

40
00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.000
at video footage and identify people on the screen.

41
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.004
Many cities are starting to use this technology

42
00:01:57.004 --> 00:02:01.008
to find missing people or identify a person's location.

43
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:04.006
Of course, there's some serious data ethics issues

44
00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:06.009
around whether or not government should be allowed

45
00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.005
to track everyone in real time.

46
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:11.002
But whether or not you think this is appropriate,

47
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:13.003
it's certainly well within the capabilities

48
00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:16.006
of AI machine learning systems.

49
00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:20.001
In the 2020 pandemic many healthcare workers

50
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:22.004
were given biometric rings.

51
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:25.002
These rings could transmit their body temperature

52
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:28.001
and other data to machine learning systems.

53
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:31.005
These systems were able to process the data in real time,

54
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.000
so it was able to predict whether there was an outbreak

55
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.002
in the hospital, but only a few healthcare staff

56
00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:39.000
wore the biometric rings.

57
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.009
Like all machine learning systems,

58
00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.009
they require lots of data to make better decisions.

59
00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.000
If millions of people were wearing the rings,

60
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.001
then it might've been a very valuable way

61
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.006
to track the spread of the virus.

62
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:52.007
If you're thinking about using this technology,

63
00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:55.002
you should start thinking about biometric data

64
00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:58.000
in the same way as your machine learning system.

65
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.001
Imagine it as complex data where the machine looks

66
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:02.003
for patterns.

67
00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:05.002
Then you should think about what value these patterns have

68
00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:06.006
to your organization.
