00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.005
- We've seen how artificial neural networks can crunch

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:05.002
enormous amounts of data

3
00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:06.008
and because it's a network,

4
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:09.008
it doesn't operate the same way as one system.

5
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:12.005
It's usually not one giant computer.

6
00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.006
Instead, it's a series of nodes

7
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:17.002
that work together to process data.

8
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:20.005
These nodes break the data into chunks,

9
00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:22.006
then they make decisions about the data

10
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:27.003
and pass the information along to nodes in the next layer.

11
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.007
In many ways, the neural network reacts

12
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:31.004
to the data it's processing,

13
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.007
so it's not like a typical computer program.

14
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:36.003
It doesn't try to map out all the possibilities

15
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:39.002
and then follow a preprogrammed route;

16
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:42.007
instead, it reacts to the data in real time.

17
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:44.008
So artificial neural networks are different

18
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:47.006
from how most organizations think about computing,

19
00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:50.007
and it might be hard to imagine how this technology

20
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:53.002
could work in your organization.

21
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.006
Before you set up your own neural network,

22
00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:57.008
you may want to consider some of the best ways

23
00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:59.009
to use this technology.

24
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.005
The first thing to keep in mind is

25
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:04.007
that neural networks learn by making mistakes.

26
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:07.008
It processes the data and then optimizes itself

27
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:09.001
in real time.

28
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.005
That means in the beginning,

29
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:12.003
your network might only be right

30
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:14.003
a small percentage of the time

31
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:17.001
but as your network learns, it will improve.

32
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.008
More and more often, it'll be correct.

33
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.004
That's why when you look at the results

34
00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:23.002
of artificial neural networks,

35
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:27.003
it's typically displayed as a probability of being correct.

36
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.001
So if you look at something like facial recognition,

37
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:31.004
you'll notice that the neural network

38
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:35.001
will say something like, "This has a 98.6% chance

39
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:38.002
"of being a certain person."

40
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:39.007
So if you can handle a lot of mistakes

41
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:41.001
at the beginning of the process,

42
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.009
you could use these networks

43
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.005
to process your organization's data,

44
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:49.002
just be sure to focus on the strengths of this technology.

45
00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:51.002
Artificial neural networks are great

46
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:57.001
for seeing associations or regularities in complex patterns.

47
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.001
This is especially true when you have a lot of diverse data

48
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.000
with patterns that are hard to recognize.

49
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.001
It can do really well

50
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:07.003
when humans don't understand these relationships

51
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:10.006
or they might be very difficult to describe.

52
00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:12.009
So imagine you work for a retail organization

53
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.000
that owns shopping malls.

54
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
You want to look at the video footage of these malls

55
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.008
and see if you can find patterns in how people shop.

56
00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:23.007
In this case, you have a very complex pattern.

57
00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:25.005
You might have thousands of people

58
00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:27.006
moving in various directions.

59
00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:30.001
It's a diverse data set because there are many people

60
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:31.008
doing many different things.

61
00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:34.001
No human could watch all this footage

62
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:36.002
and come up with a pattern,

63
00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:39.007
but an artificial neural network can process all this data

64
00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:41.004
and make recommendations

65
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:43.003
about where to put different stores.

66
00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:45.003
The network could look for patterns,

67
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:46.006
then it could create visuals

68
00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:49.003
that show the heaviest traffic areas.

69
00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:51.003
So if you're thinking about using this technology,

70
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.002
keep these strengths in mind.

71
00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:54.008
Remember that the machine will learn

72
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:56.009
as it processes the data.

73
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.004
So if you let it make a few mistakes in the beginning,

74
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:02.004
you can gain some real valuable insights.
