00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.005
- Deep learning is one of the most interesting areas

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:05.003
in artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:07.003
But when you're looking at different tools,

4
00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:09.009
it's easy to mix up deep learning tools

5
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.006
with machine learning.

6
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.007
You can usually use any deep learning tool

7
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:17.008
to also do standard machine learning.

8
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:20.001
Remember that the difference between deep learning

9
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:21.005
and machine learning

10
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.005
is a matter of how many hidden layers you have

11
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:26.006
in your artificial neural network.

12
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.009
So in a sense, deep learning is just

13
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.004
very deep machine learning.

14
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:32.004
With that being said,

15
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:34.007
there are still some tools that specialize

16
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:38.002
in creating deep learning artificial neural networks.

17
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:39.009
Some of these are software tools

18
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:41.009
that you can install on your own systems.

19
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.009
While many of them are also services that you can use

20
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:48.002
to upload and analyze your own data.

21
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.006
Let's bring out the computer one more time,

22
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:55.009
so we can look through some of these deep learning tools.

23
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:56.008
Let's start by looking

24
00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:58.006
at some of the great deep learning platforms

25
00:00:58.006 --> 00:00:59.009
that are available.

26
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.005
We'll start with one of the most popular,

27
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:06.003
which was created by the Google Brain Project in 2011.

28
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:09.003
TensorFlow is an open source end-to-end

29
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.000
machine learning platform

30
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.006
that you can use with most cloud-based services.

31
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:17.003
It works with all the services we saw earlier,

32
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:21.004
Amazon, IBM Watson, and Microsoft Azure.

33
00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:23.005
TensorFlow is cross-platform,

34
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:24.009
so that means that it runs

35
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.004
on a lot of different architectures.

36
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.005
You can run it on servers, smartphones,

37
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:34.003
and it even works on GPUs, or graphics processing units.

38
00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:37.000
It abstracts a lot of the hardware using something

39
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.002
called the TensorFlow Distributed Execution Engine.

40
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:43.000
And then on top of the front-ends,

41
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.007
you have a bunch of models you can use

42
00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.007
to train and evaluate your data.

43
00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:48.009
One of the most popular is Keras.

44
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.003
So you can see that there's a guide

45
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:52.001
on how to install TensorFlow

46
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:54.005
and how to migrate to the next version of TensorFlow,

47
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:57.007
which is currently TensorFlow 2.0.

48
00:01:57.007 --> 00:01:58.008
If you look at some of the code

49
00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:01.001
that's included here in TensorFlow,

50
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:04.008
you can see that it includes a library called Keras.

51
00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:06.007
Now, if you go to Karas' website,

52
00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:10.002
you can learn more about this open source project.

53
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:11.009
You can click getting started,

54
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.001
and you can see an introduction here,

55
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.003
and it lists out the guides and the API.

56
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:19.006
Keras is a library written in Python

57
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:21.009
that sits on top of TensorFlow.

58
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.007
It's a very popular way to work with training data

59
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:26.009
in TensorFlow.

60
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:28.008
Another framework which you might want to use

61
00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:33.002
is the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, or CNTK.

62
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:35.008
This is also part of the open neural network,

63
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:39.008
which is ONNX, and it's another competing framework.

64
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:44.000
You can also use Keras as part of CNTK,

65
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.004
like Keras, it's a Python library,

66
00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:50.003
and you can go to GitHub and see CNTK here.

67
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.002
You can also see how to install.

68
00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:56.007
This has been released by Microsoft under the MIT license.

69
00:02:56.007 --> 00:03:00.003
You can see here that you can install CNTK in Windows,

70
00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:03.002
Unix, and other operating systems.

71
00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:06.002
If you're using your deep learning artificial neural network

72
00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:09.000
to identify objects, it might be worthwhile

73
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.007
to take a look at another framework called Caffe.

74
00:03:12.007 --> 00:03:17.003
It was developed by Berkeley AI Research, or BAIR.

75
00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:19.000
Again, you could view this on GitHub,

76
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.002
it's available under the very permissive BSD license.

77
00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:26.003
The GitHub page will give you an idea of how to install it.

78
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:27.009
If you want to learn a little bit more about it,

79
00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:30.006
you could click on this Caffe in a Day

80
00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:33.003
and it takes you to this slide show presentation

81
00:03:33.003 --> 00:03:36.002
that gives you a lot of really specific examples

82
00:03:36.002 --> 00:03:38.007
on using this framework for vision

83
00:03:38.007 --> 00:03:42.008
to do some deep learning image classification.

84
00:03:42.008 --> 00:03:45.002
So let's just close that up.

85
00:03:45.002 --> 00:03:46.003
If you're just starting out

86
00:03:46.003 --> 00:03:48.003
using these deep learning frameworks,

87
00:03:48.003 --> 00:03:51.001
then you might want to take a closer look at TensorFlow.

88
00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:53.002
It's one of the most active and popular ways

89
00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:54.009
to create these networks

90
00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.007
on almost all popular cloud-based services.

91
00:03:57.007 --> 00:03:59.004
You can also run it on your own server,

92
00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:01.007
smartphones, and many other devices.

93
00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:04.006
It abstracts away most of the technical challenges

94
00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:06.009
you get into when building these networks.

95
00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.001
And you have a lot of flexibility

96
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:12.000
to run it on top of your existing technology.
