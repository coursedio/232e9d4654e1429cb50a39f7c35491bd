00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.003
- Machine learning is one of the richest areas

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.000
in artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.008
That's because most companies are still struggling

4
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:09.008
on what to do with their data.

5
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:12.000
A lot of companies have gotten really good

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.004
at collecting massive amounts of data.

7
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, the challenge is turning that data into something

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.001
that can help with accurate predictions and analysis.

9
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.001
The good news about machine learning is that

10
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.002
since it's been around for such a long time,

11
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:27.008
there are many different tools to choose from.

12
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:29.003
Companies and universities

13
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:31.009
have been developing tools for decades.

14
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.008
Most of them are easily available and free to use.

15
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:38.002
Now remember that machine learning is often the tool

16
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:41.003
you'll use to build many of your AI systems.

17
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.008
That means that you can use machine learning tools,

18
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:47.004
to build systems in natural language processing,

19
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:51.006
automated decision making, and even speech recognition.

20
00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:53.008
I brought up my computer here again,

21
00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:55.007
so let's start looking at some of these

22
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:59.003
great machine learning tools.

23
00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:01.002
If you just started learning about machine learning,

24
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:02.008
one of the very best places to start

25
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:05.006
is with a project called Scikit-learn.

26
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.002
You can go to Scikit-learn here, you can see that

27
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:12.001
this is a machine learning implementation in Python.

28
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.002
It's built on a bunch of Python projects

29
00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:15.007
and it's open source.

30
00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.001
You can even use it in your projects

31
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:21.000
because it uses the very permissive BSD license.

32
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The reason why this is such a good place to start,

33
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.002
is it's really powerful,

34
00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:26.004
you can use a lot of machine learning algorithms

35
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:29.001
like classification and clustering.

36
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.001
There's even support for regression.

37
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.006
So this is a great project,

38
00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:34.009
and you can actually use Scikit-learn

39
00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.005
on top of cloud-based machine learning platforms

40
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:40.009
from Microsoft and IBM.

41
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.004
A lot of companies also use these

42
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:45.000
cloud-based machine learning services.

43
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
One of the big ones is Amazon.

44
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.005
And so this is machine learning service

45
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:51.007
that you can get on Amazon.

46
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:53.006
SageMaker is one of the big services

47
00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:56.001
that they have on their machine learning platform.

48
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:58.005
As you can imagine, SageMaker connects up

49
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.002
with a lot of Amazon's other cloud-based services.

50
00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:04.009
So that means you could upload your organizational data

51
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.008
to one of their cloud databases,

52
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:10.000
and then use SageMakers' machine learning algorithms

53
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.006
to analyze that data.

54
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:14.007
Another cloud-based machine learning service

55
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:16.009
is from Microsoft.

56
00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:20.001
It's part of their Azure cloud services platform.

57
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:23.001
You can actually use their Scikit-learn framework,

58
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:26.000
on top of this Azure machine learning platform,

59
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.008
along with others.

60
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:29.001
You can also use something called

61
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:31.004
the Machine Learning Studio.

62
00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:33.002
This tool allows you to upload data

63
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:35.002
and use drag and drop elements,

64
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:36.008
to analyze the data,

65
00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:39.002
with their machine learning algorithms.

66
00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:40.009
Another big cloud platform,

67
00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.004
is IBM Watson Machine Learning.

68
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:45.008
And again, you can use a lot of the top frameworks

69
00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:47.005
with this cloud platform.

70
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:50.007
You can use Scikit-learn and some other great platforms,

71
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:52.008
that you'll see later on.

72
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:55.006
This platform uses a concept they call pipelines.

73
00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:58.005
You can pipeline in different data sources

74
00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:01.007
and analyze the data using machine learning.

75
00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:04.006
You can also stream data in from other sources.

76
00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:07.002
Here's an example of how you can save a branch model,

77
00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:10.003
from the statistics software package, SPSS,

78
00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:14.000
using this Watson Machine Learning Platform.

79
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.004
There's a lot of variability

80
00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:17.003
between these different services.

81
00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:20.007
Amazon and Microsoft do classification and clustering,

82
00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:24.006
while IBM focuses mostly on just classification.

83
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:27.001
Microsoft has a recommendation engine,

84
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:29.001
while the other two do not.

85
00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:32.006
Amazon and IBM have built in machine learning algorithms,

86
00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:35.006
but with Microsoft, you have to bring your own.

87
00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:37.003
But most of them have the flexibility

88
00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:40.002
to use frameworks like Scikit-learn.

89
00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:41.005
And as you'll see later,

90
00:03:41.005 --> 00:03:45.002
they all support the popular TensorFlow framework.
