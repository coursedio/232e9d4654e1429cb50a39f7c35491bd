00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.007
- So now you've seen that machine learning algorithms

2
00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:06.002
can act like giant label guns.

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:09.003
Classifying and clustering data together.

4
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:11.006
And these algorithms can be pretty powerful.

5
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.002
They can classify people as good loan candidates,

6
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:18.000
they can find students who might succeed at your university.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.006
One challenge with these machine learning algorithms

8
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:23.004
is that they can be pretty processor intensive.

9
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.005
As you can imagine, it takes a very powerful system

10
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.005
to look through petabytes of data.

11
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:31.002
But this challenge isn't a new one.

12
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:35.006
And as far back as the early 1940s, computer scientists

13
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:38.003
were considering ways to expand the power

14
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:40.005
of computing systems.

15
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.003
What they came up with was something called

16
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:45.001
an Artificial Neural Network.

17
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:48.007
These networks are loosely inspired by the physiology

18
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:50.006
of the human brain.

19
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:53.005
A neuron is a nerve cell in your brain, that forms

20
00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:56.005
a network to communicate and store information.

21
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.005
Your biological neurons communicate with each other

22
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:02.002
through something called synapses.

23
00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:05.004
These are small gaps between the cells that send electrical

24
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:07.006
and chemical impulses.

25
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:10.001
An artificial neural network uses

26
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:14.005
something called artificial neurons or nodes.

27
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:17.009
These nodes connect to other nodes in the network

28
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.008
and pass information through electrical signals.

29
00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:24.007
The network is typically arranged in layers.

30
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:27.004
The first layer is called the input layer.

31
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:30.009
And this layer is responsible for accepting the data.

32
00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.007
The data then goes through other layers

33
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:37.008
of processing, before it goes out the output layer.

34
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:40.004
So think of it this way, imagine you had a room

35
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:41.008
with 20 people.

36
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:44.005
These people were arranged in four rows

37
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:46.007
of five people each.

38
00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:49.004
Each person is holding a notepad.

39
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.001
Now imagine you have a deck of playing cards.

40
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:55.000
You start passing out a card to each person

41
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.005
in the front row.

42
00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:58.006
If the card is red, they'd pass it to

43
00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:00.009
the person right behind them.

44
00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.006
If the card is black, then they'd pass it to the person next

45
00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:06.007
to the person behind them.

46
00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:10.001
Each row of people does the exact same thing.

47
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:13.003
Now using their notepads, people would also keep track

48
00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:17.005
of every time they received a red or black card.

49
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:20.001
If they received more red cards, then they would start

50
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:23.003
to learn that red was the more common color.

51
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:27.002
Then the people behind them would also share their notes.

52
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:29.004
Over time, this group of people would be able

53
00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:33.002
to process cards into red and black very quickly.

54
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:35.002
They'd also be able to accurately predict

55
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:39.004
whether their card was more likely to be red or black.

56
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:41.005
The point of creating a system like this

57
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:44.002
is that it becomes very good at classifying

58
00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:47.001
and clustering massive amounts of data.

59
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.006
And you're able to distribute the processing power

60
00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:52.001
to a network of individual nodes.

61
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:53.008
So instead of having one computer trying

62
00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:56.000
to do everything, you can have a network

63
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.002
of nodes using very simple algorithms.

64
00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:03.003
These artificial neural networks can really expand

65
00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:05.005
the capabilities of machine learning.

66
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:07.009
They allow artificial intelligence systems

67
00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:08.008
to find extremely complex patterns

68
00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:13.008
while sifting through, massive amounts of data.
