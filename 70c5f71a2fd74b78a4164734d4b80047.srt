00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] Let's start looking at some tools

2
00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:05.000
for Natural Language Generation or NLG.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.008
We'll start out with an open source tool called SimpleNLG.

4
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.004
You could find it on GitHub.

5
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.006
Here, SimpleNLG.

6
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:15.002
You can see it's actively maintained.

7
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:18.001
This project was started by a university professor

8
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.006
named Ehud Reiter from the university

9
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.002
of Aberdeen in Scotland.

10
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.006
He later founded a company called Arria

11
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.001
which we'll see in a few minutes.

12
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.000
SimpleNLG is a realization engine

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.004
for Natural Language Generation.

14
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:35.005
It tries to produce natural sounding text.

15
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:38.002
To get started, you can just click on this tutorial here.

16
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.007
You can just click on Getting Started.

17
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.003
SimpleNLG is a Java library.

18
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:44.009
You can just download the zip file

19
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:49.003
and import it and can start using as Java class immediately.

20
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:51.003
Professor Reiter's blog is a pretty good source

21
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:53.003
of information on NLG.

22
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.005
It has a pretty imposing picture of him

23
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:58.006
and some great links to NLG resources.

24
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.008
He's also coauthored a book on NLG

25
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:04.008
called Building Natural Language Generation Systems.

26
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:07.000
This would be a great guide if you're a researcher

27
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.008
or a software developer looking to get

28
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:11.003
into natural language generation.

29
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:14.000
He also helped start a company called Arria,

30
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.003
which is one of the top commercial NLG platforms.

31
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:20.003
They have a product called NLG Studio,

32
00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:22.005
so you can scroll down here.

33
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:25.005
Their focus is taking structured data that you might get

34
00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:27.009
from a corporate database and then combining it

35
00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.007
with natural language.

36
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:31.003
So that means you could take a nice chart

37
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:33.001
from Microsoft SQL Server

38
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:36.002
and then create natural language to describe the data.

39
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:39.004
There's a competing platform from Automated Insights,

40
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:41.005
which does something very similar.

41
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:44.001
They have a product called Wordsmith.

42
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:46.003
I'm just going to close this out here.

43
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:48.009
Wordsmith is really about creating stories

44
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.000
that sound like they were generated from a human author.

45
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.002
You can see here that the Automated Press uses Wordsmith.

46
00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:57.009
Remember earlier, we had an example about using NLG

47
00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.005
for updating corporate earnings reports.

48
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:03.007
That's one area where you can really use this product.

49
00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:07.000
Like Arria, you can use this tool to add explanations

50
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.004
to structured data.

51
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:12.006
There's another company called Narrative Science.

52
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:15.008
This company is in Chicago and they started out using NLG

53
00:02:15.008 --> 00:02:18.006
to create stories that summarize sporting events.

54
00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:21.000
Since then they moved away from sports journalism

55
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.005
and more into corporate reporting.

56
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:25.009
Their main product is called Quill.

57
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.001
Much like the other NLG services,

58
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:31.003
it also focuses mostly on corporate dashboards

59
00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:34.001
and reporting on structured data.

60
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:37.005
It uses NLG to explain complex data visualizations

61
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:40.001
to managers and executives.

62
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:42.000
So there are some of the great tools that you can use

63
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.008
when using NLG at your organization.

64
00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:47.002
Each of these platforms has its own area

65
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:48.007
in which they excel.

66
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:50.007
Quill focuses more on readability

67
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:52.005
while the other two products try to focus more

68
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.002
on interpreting the data.

69
00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:55.009
That means that one of these platforms

70
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.000
may work better than the other

71
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.009
based on your organization's needs.
