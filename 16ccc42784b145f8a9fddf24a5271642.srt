00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.006
- You can use machine learning algorithms

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:04.007
to find patterns in your data.

3
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:08.001
Then you label the data in a few different ways.

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:09.008
With supervised machine learning,

5
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.007
you create your own labels,

6
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:16.002
and then the machine classifies the data using these labels.

7
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.004
With unsupervised machine learning,

8
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.000
you let the machine create its own labels

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.003
and organize the data into clusters.

10
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:27.009
Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, along with others,

11
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.002
have created their own machine learning systems as services.

12
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:33.001
That way, you can simply

13
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.003
give these services access to your data,

14
00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:38.002
and allow them to do the heavy processing.

15
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.009
You'll see a few of these later on.

16
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.001
But as you can imagine,

17
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.006
working with these machine learning algorithms

18
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:46.005
can get complicated.

19
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.008
It's also difficult to gather and maintain

20
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:50.004
all the data that you need

21
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:53.004
to help these systems make decisions.

22
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:54.006
So you might be thinking,

23
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:56.000
"Why would your organization want to

24
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.009
go through all this trouble?"

25
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.003
There's certainly value in labeling your data,

26
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:03.008
but how will your business benefit from this labeling?

27
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:05.003
For that, you have to remember

28
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:08.002
that your organizational data itself

29
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:10.002
doesn't have that much value.

30
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:11.006
But what does have value

31
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:14.008
are the insights that you gather from the data.

32
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:17.002
In fact, one of the most valuable insights

33
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:18.006
you can get from your data

34
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:23.001
is around helping your company to make better predictions.

35
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:24.007
So think of it this way.

36
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:26.004
You could take several steps

37
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:29.001
to better predict your customer's behavior.

38
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.002
You could send a representative from your company

39
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:32.005
to interview them.

40
00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:35.003
You could gather information about their interests

41
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.000
and their friends' interests.

42
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.007
You could invite in all their friends and family,

43
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:43.003
and ask them questions in a large focus group.

44
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:46.001
After all that, you'd probably do a pretty good job

45
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:48.007
predicting your customer's behavior.

46
00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:53.000
But taking these steps is very expensive and time-consuming.

47
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.007
In fact, if you did this for all your customers,

48
00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:58.000
you'd probably go out of business.

49
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.002
On the other hand, what machine learning allows you to do

50
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:04.005
is to push down the cost of these predictions.

51
00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:08.002
So you can still get the benefit of all these extra insights

52
00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.004
without all the costs.

53
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:12.007
When prediction becomes incredibly cheap,

54
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.002
then the range of things

55
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:16.002
that your organization can accomplish

56
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.005
becomes much greater.

57
00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:21.005
This might seem like a strange or abstract concept,

58
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:24.003
but many organizations are already benefiting

59
00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:26.008
from better predictions.

60
00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:30.004
A lot of websites are very good at making suggestions

61
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:32.006
about what you might want to purchase.

62
00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:34.006
Streaming services like Netflix

63
00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:38.003
are very good at recommending new shows.

64
00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:42.000
This level of prediction used to be very costly,

65
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.002
but now machine learning is pushing down that cost.

66
00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:48.002
So to get the most from machine learning,

67
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.002
think about how you can use prediction

68
00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:52.004
to better serve your customers.

69
00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:54.005
If you can better predict their behavior,

70
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:58.001
then you can do a much better job understanding their needs.
