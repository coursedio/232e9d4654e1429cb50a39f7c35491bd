00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.007
- Many of these artificial intelligence tools and concepts

2
00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:07.004
are difficult to break down into distinct groups.

3
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:11.001
A lot of times what you see is a combination of AI tools

4
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:15.005
blended together to create a complex system.

5
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:19.000
You've seen AI automated decision-making systems.

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.003
These work well when the system needs to make

7
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:25.005
analytical decisions based on large data sets.

8
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:26.007
You've also learned a little bit

9
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:29.001
about natural language processing.

10
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.000
This is usually broken down into two separate processes.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.006
There's natural language understanding, or NLU,

12
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:40.009
and natural language generation, or NLG.

13
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:44.002
There's also another closely related technology called

14
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:48.002
automated speech recognition or ASR.

15
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.006
A lot of organizations are starting to plan out

16
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:54.001
how to use these different tools to meet their needs.

17
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.006
So imagine you work for an organization that wants to build

18
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:59.007
an automated customer response system.

19
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:01.005
Let's say that you want your customers to be able

20
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:05.007
to open up an online chat, then make quick changes to items

21
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:08.008
that they've purchased from your website.

22
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:12.000
This chat system could use natural language processing.

23
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.006
It would translate what the customer asks

24
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:17.002
into something the system can understand.

25
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:19.007
Then you could use automated decision making

26
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:23.006
to make real changes to the order in real time.

27
00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.007
That means your customers could make changes

28
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:29.000
just by chatting with your automated system.

29
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.001
There are many ways that businesses could benefit

30
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.004
from a combination of both automated decision making

31
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:36.009
and natural language processing.

32
00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.006
This could be useful if your organization

33
00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:40.009
works with logistics.

34
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.006
A package delivery company could reroute shipments based on

35
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:47.000
information they get from the customer.

36
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.001
You might reroute a package to where the customer works

37
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:53.003
or leave their package with a trusted neighbor.

38
00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:56.004
Or for the airline industry, a customer could ask questions

39
00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:59.004
about alternative flights and then get rerouted

40
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:02.001
using the same system.

41
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.003
If you work in manufacturing, you might be able

42
00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:07.002
to set up a system that could answer questions.

43
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:10.005
This same system could even set up emergency deliveries

44
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:13.006
to some of your most loyal customers.

45
00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:16.003
Your system could automate all these requests

46
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:19.004
long after your employees have gone home.

47
00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:21.005
There's certainly online tools that your company

48
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:24.002
currently uses that might be able to accomplish

49
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:26.002
some of the same things.

50
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:29.003
But an automated decision-making system will also be able

51
00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:32.006
to incorporate massive amounts of new data.

52
00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:34.009
If your customer is trying to reroute their flight,

53
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:36.007
then they might not want to research

54
00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:39.004
all your airline's available routes.

55
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:40.009
If they want to change their order,

56
00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.009
then they might not be aware of everything

57
00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.008
that's for sale in your product catalog.

58
00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:49.002
An AI decision-making system will analyze all this data

59
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.001
and make decisions on your customer's behalf.

60
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:55.000
If you combine it with NLP, then the system can

61
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.005
communicate with your customer in a way that feels familiar.
