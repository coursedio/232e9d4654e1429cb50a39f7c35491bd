00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.008
- In the 1939 World's Fair,

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:04.005
one of the most popular attractions

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.009
was a 250-pound robot named Elektro.

4
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.005
He dazzled audiences while smoking,

5
00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:14.006
blowing up balloons, and even telling jokes.

6
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:16.009
Many people believed they were just a few years away

7
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.001
from having their own Elektro

8
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:23.000
so it would vacuum their floors or drive them to work.

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.004
But as impressive as Elektro was, he had a serious flaw.

10
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:30.003
He was automated, but not intelligent.

11
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:33.002
So when you pressed a button, he could blow up a balloon,

12
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:36.007
but he didn't have the ability to learn and grow.

13
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:39.006
If you fast forward to today, you still see this confusion

14
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.007
around artificial intelligence and automation.

15
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:44.005
And some of this is intentional.

16
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:47.002
Many software and hardware vendors eagerly

17
00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:50.002
and often incorrectly label their products

18
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:52.007
as artificial intelligence.

19
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.008
If you want to use this technology,

20
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:56.007
then it's important to understand the difference

21
00:00:56.007 --> 00:01:00.007
between automation and artificial intelligence.

22
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:04.004
One of the very best books on artificial intelligence is

23
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.007
"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach"

24
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.009
by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig.

25
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.008
In this textbook,

26
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:14.005
the authors talk about how AI extends the reach

27
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:17.006
of the designer into unknown environments.

28
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:20.008
In a sense, the system will improve without any help

29
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:22.007
from the original designer.

30
00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:25.005
So a defining component of AI is

31
00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:28.003
that it will learn and grow.

32
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:30.008
That means if you're thinking about using this technology,

33
00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:33.006
you should push back on any software vendor

34
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:38.000
that labels simple automation as artificial intelligence.

35
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.006
In fact, as a customer, you probably see this all the time.

36
00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:43.007
Your tax software might advertise

37
00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:47.000
that they use artificial intelligence to check your returns,

38
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.005
but the system isn't really coming up with a new way

39
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:51.004
for you to save on your taxes.

40
00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:54.009
It's simply following very routine automation

41
00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.007
on well-established tax code.

42
00:01:57.007 --> 00:01:59.000
There's also a growing area

43
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.002
of robotic process automation, or RPA.

44
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:04.008
This is when software observes

45
00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:07.001
how a human interacts with their computer.

46
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:10.000
Then it tries to repeat the same sequence.

47
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.005
These systems are sometimes called artificial intelligence,

48
00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:16.003
but they're really just standard automation.

49
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:19.003
The software bots do exactly what they were shown,

50
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:21.007
almost like an old style tape recorder.

51
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:24.004
They never learn or adapt.

52
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:25.009
Another area you might see this is

53
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.006
with AI enhanced hardware.

54
00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:30.006
AI systems usually require a lot

55
00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:33.001
of floating point arithmetic.

56
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.005
This is a very resource-intensive type of computing.

57
00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:39.001
That's why a lot of these earlier systems

58
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:42.005
used graphics processing units, or GPUs,

59
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:44.005
for better performance.

60
00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:47.005
In fact, a lot of the AI enhanced hardware comes

61
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:50.006
from companies that manufactured graphics cards.

62
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:52.003
It turns out that the graphics card

63
00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:55.003
that helps you play video games is also very good

64
00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:57.004
at AI processing.

65
00:02:57.004 --> 00:02:59.009
But like robotics processing automation,

66
00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:03.008
this technology is not in itself intelligent.

67
00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:05.006
So if you're using this technology,

68
00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:07.008
you should really think of it in two ways.

69
00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:10.008
Are the products you're buying actually using some form

70
00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:12.006
of artificial intelligence,

71
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:15.006
or is this an impressive set of automations?

72
00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:17.001
Second, you should think about the ways

73
00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:19.008
you want to label your own products.

74
00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:22.001
The marketing team might be enthusiastic

75
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:25.007
about the label of AI, but you should consider

76
00:03:25.007 --> 00:03:27.006
whether you're actually creating products

77
00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:29.006
that can learn and grow.

78
00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:32.002
If these products can improve themselves over time,

79
00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:36.006
then they really are enhanced with artificial intelligence.
