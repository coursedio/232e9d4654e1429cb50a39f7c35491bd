00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.003
- So far we've seen how natural language processing

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:08.007
or NLP can be broken down into two main AI concepts.

3
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:12.000
There's natural language generation or NLG.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.005
This is where the AI system outputs texts

5
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.002
in a way that sounds more human.

6
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:21.002
Then there's natural language understanding or NLU.

7
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:25.006
This is when an AI system can analyze human generated text

8
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.007
and understand the overall meaning.

9
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:32.007
There's also automated speech recognition or ASR.

10
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:35.001
This allows a person to speak normally

11
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.005
then the ASR system recognizes these sounds

12
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:42.000
and transcribes them into text.

13
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.004
So when you combine natural language processing

14
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:48.002
with automated speech recognition,

15
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:51.000
you end up with an AI system that can interact

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.006
in a way that feels conversational.

17
00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:54.005
In fact,

18
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.002
it's these combined concepts

19
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:59.001
that people are most familiar with.

20
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.005
Some of the largest companies,

21
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.005
such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon,

22
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:09.007
are creating virtual assistants that combine NLP and ASR.

23
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:13.001
When you talk to Siri, Cortana, or Google Assistant,

24
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:16.001
you might view this as one technology.

25
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:17.002
But in reality,

26
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:20.003
it's like combination of all of these technologies.

27
00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:24.000
They work together to create a seamless experience.

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.009
But when you're thinking about these concepts

29
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.002
in your business,

30
00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:31.005
you should really think about them as separate AI systems.

31
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:34.003
That way you'll apply the most appropriate technology

32
00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:37.009
without spending extra money on things you don't need.

33
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.005
So think of it this way.

34
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:41.007
Amazon has encouraged businesses

35
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:44.007
to use their virtual assistant Alexa

36
00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.008
to help book conference rooms.

37
00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:49.004
But most large companies don't call people

38
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:51.007
on the phone to book these rooms.

39
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:53.009
That means that they don't really need

40
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.001
automated speech recognition or ASR.

41
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:57.009
In fact,

42
00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.004
you might recognize that natural language understanding

43
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:04.002
or NLU is the biggest challenge

44
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:08.000
when using an AI system to book a conference room.

45
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.009
If the system understands what a person is saying,

46
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.003
then it shouldn't be too difficult

47
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:15.002
to connect to a scheduling system.

48
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.004
And it doesn't seem to necessary to spend too much time

49
00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:20.008
with natural language generation or NLG.

50
00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:23.005
Most of the response will just be the system telling you

51
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:26.004
whether the conference room is available.

52
00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:27.003
So in this case,

53
00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:30.005
it might make sense to use a virtual agent.

54
00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:33.003
This can simply be a chatbot or an agent

55
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:35.008
that responds to texts or email.

56
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:38.002
That way people in your organization can open up

57
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:42.000
a chatbot client and have a simple text conversation.

58
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
In this case,

59
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.005
you understood that NLU would be the biggest challenge.

60
00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:49.006
So you put a lot more emphasis on these tools

61
00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:52.006
than you would on automated speech recognition

62
00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:55.001
or natural language generation.

63
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:57.007
When you're using these tools to build your own system,

64
00:02:57.007 --> 00:03:00.001
you should think about it in the same way.

65
00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.008
Will your system spend most of the time writing,

66
00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:06.000
understanding, or listening.

67
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.005
That way you can build a system

68
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:10.003
that will be the most helpful for what you need.
