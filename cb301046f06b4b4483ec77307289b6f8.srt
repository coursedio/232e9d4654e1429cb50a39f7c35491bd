00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.008
- Now let's take a look

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:03.008
at how you can connect machine learning

3
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:06.006
to some other tools and concepts.

4
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.001
Let's think about how this might work

5
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.004
with something like natural language processing.

6
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.001
Remember that machine learning

7
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:16.001
generally can be used in two different ways.

8
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.003
There's supervised machine learning,

9
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:19.007
where you provide the algorithm

10
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:21.009
with an initial training set.

11
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.005
And then unsupervised machine learning,

12
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:28.003
where the algorithm discovers its own patterns in the data.

13
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:29.005
So imagine you wanted to build

14
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:32.009
an NLP machine learning system.

15
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.009
This new system would process

16
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:38.005
all of the social media data on your organization.

17
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:41.006
Then it would summarize this data into a weekly report

18
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:45.009
so that executives know how people feel about your company.

19
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.000
If you are in charge of developing this application,

20
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.007
would you use supervised or unsupervised machine learning?

21
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.003
With supervised machine learning,

22
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:58.001
you could try to classify your data into different moods.

23
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:00.009
In this case, your team would label the moods,

24
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:04.006
and then find social media to put into the training set.

25
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:08.000
So maybe you would create a mood called satisfied

26
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.008
and then your team would find posts of satisfied customers.

27
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.002
You can then use this technique to generate

28
00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:19.000
dozens or even hundreds of different labeled moods.

29
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.004
Once you have this training set,

30
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.006
you could train your machine learning system

31
00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:27.004
to find millions of posts that follow the same pattern.

32
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:30.002
What do you think of the advantages and disadvantages

33
00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:34.000
of this type of supervised machine learning system?

34
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.002
One thing you might notice

35
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:39.000
is that your team creates the initial moods.

36
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.005
So in a sense, you're creating the labels

37
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:45.007
and then trying to fit the data into these categories.

38
00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:48.000
That means that the system could break down

39
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.005
if the data doesn't fit into one of these moods.

40
00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:54.009
If a customer wasn't satisfied or dissatisfied,

41
00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.002
then the system would have trouble knowing what to do.

42
00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:00.006
On the other hand, you could have the system

43
00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:03.000
cluster the data into different groups

44
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.008
that it identifies on its own.

45
00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:08.008
So you could use unsupervised machine learning

46
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:10.009
and natural language processing

47
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.000
to cluster the data into groups.

48
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.001
So the result would be that the machine learning system

49
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.004
would create clusters of social media data.

50
00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:22.007
If it worked well, then these clusters

51
00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:25.002
generally would be saying the same thing.

52
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:27.008
Then you could look at each cluster and try to figure out

53
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:30.001
what the customer is trying to communicate.

54
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.008
Maybe it's sarcasm, disappointment,

55
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:35.005
or a completely new idea.

56
00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.007
This might work well if your organization

57
00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:41.001
is involved with something completely new or unexpected.

58
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:43.008
Maybe a famous celebrity used your product,

59
00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:45.009
or maybe there's a defect in your product

60
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.008
that hasn't been identified by your engineers.

61
00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:52.001
So in some ways, an unsupervised machine learning system

62
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:54.006
has a lot more flexibility.

63
00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:58.006
At the same time, this flexibility has a cost.

64
00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:02.004
You might get what's called a lot of noise in your data.

65
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:04.007
That means that the system will probably find groups

66
00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:06.006
that are difficult to identify.

67
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:10.006
Some of them may even appear randomly clustered together.

68
00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:12.009
So if you're thinking about using this technology,

69
00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:14.009
try to balance the flexibility

70
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.009
of unsupervised machine learning

71
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.008
against the clear classifications you get

72
00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:22.000
from supervised machine learning.
