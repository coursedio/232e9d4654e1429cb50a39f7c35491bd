00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:01.007
- It might seem like a lot of

2
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:04.001
these artificial intelligence tools are trying

3
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.002
to accomplish very different things.

4
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:09.006
Natural language processing converts the human language

5
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:13.003
into something that a computer could understand.

6
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:16.007
Automated decision-making makes analytical decisions

7
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.005
based on historical trends and data.

8
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:23.005
But the reality is from the perspective of an AI system,

9
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:27.000
these tools in concepts are actually very similar.

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.003
With both of these systems,

11
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:33.001
you're looking for patterns in massive datasets.

12
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.004
With natural language processing,

13
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:38.000
the system is looking for patterns in the way

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.007
that people communicate.

15
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:42.007
Then it looks at a massive database of similar patterns

16
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:45.001
to see if it can find a match.

17
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.003
With AI decision making,

18
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:50.000
the system is looking for patterns of previous transactions.

19
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.009
So when a flight gets canceled,

20
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.009
the system knows that when this happens,

21
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.004
they reroute to a different flight.

22
00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:01.003
Both of these systems rely on massive datasets

23
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:04.005
and sophisticated pattern matching.

24
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:08.009
That's why both of these systems use very similar concepts

25
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.001
to accomplish these tasks.

26
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:14.003
The most popular way to develop these systems

27
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:17.000
is by using machine learning.

28
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.004
Machine learning is essentially a set of algorithms

29
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:26.002
that helps AI systems see patterns in massive data sets.

30
00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.001
Then the machine learning algorithms

31
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:31.005
typically label the data so it can be classified

32
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:34.006
or clustered together.

33
00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:36.007
Now it may surprise you, but machine learning

34
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:40.000
has actually been around for nearly 70 years.

35
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.002
Recently, it got a big boost because search engines

36
00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:46.003
like Google and Bing use machine learning

37
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:48.005
to classify webpages.

38
00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:51.007
So when you type the word cat into a search engine,

39
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:55.005
it searches it's massive database to see which web pages

40
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:59.008
it's labeled with the keyword, cat.

41
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:03.000
These machine learning algorithms crawl the web,

42
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.006
so they can classify billions of webpages based on keywords.

43
00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:12.000
These algorithms are a bit like giant labeled guns,

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.001
organizing websites the same way

45
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.002
you might label your spice cabinet.

46
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:21.009
But again, even the one system classifies web pages

47
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.002
and the other tries to make decisions

48
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:25.009
or understand the language,

49
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:29.001
the underlying concept is very similar.

50
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:31.001
Data is being labeled based

51
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:34.009
on the machine learning's classification algorithm.

52
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.003
With natural language processing,

53
00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:39.004
you labeled different phrases,

54
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:41.009
so the system knows how to respond.

55
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.008
So if you say something like, I don't understand,

56
00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:47.004
it can label that text as a question,

57
00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:50.008
then connect it to the most popular response.

58
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:53.009
So you can think of machine learning as a broader concept

59
00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:59.002
that helps many other AI tools label massive data sets.

60
00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:02.004
In many ways, this data labeling is a key ingredient

61
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:05.009
to make these AI systems work well.

62
00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.001
But much like any other key ingredient,

63
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:10.008
machine learning can be mixed and matched with other things

64
00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:13.003
or just used on its own.

65
00:03:13.003 --> 00:03:16.003
Later, we'll take a look at what might work best

66
00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:18.005
for your organization.
