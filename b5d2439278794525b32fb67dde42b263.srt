00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.007
- So we know that Machine Learning is like a giant label gun

2
00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:07.000
that classifies tremendous amounts of data.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.009
But to classify machine learning algorithms

4
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.005
still rely on humans to identify

5
00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.007
what it is they're labeling.

6
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:16.009
This is typically called training

7
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.000
your machine learning algorithms.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.001
So let's imagine you start a business

9
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.004
where you sort through tons of trash

10
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.006
to separate out the recyclable material.

11
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.008
From a machine learning perspective,

12
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.008
this is a very complicated data challenge.

13
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:35.001
There might be thousands of pieces of garbage

14
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.007
going down the conveyor belt

15
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:38.005
and the machine learning algorithm

16
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:41.003
needs to identify each piece.

17
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:42.008
From a data perspective,

18
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:46.003
this is a pretty standard classification problem.

19
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:50.005
A human operator trains the system on what's recyclable.

20
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:54.005
So in this case, you'll make piles of aluminum, plastic,

21
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.008
cardboard, and paper.

22
00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:58.008
Then you'd make piles of food waste

23
00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:00.009
or plastic bags.

24
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:04.007
These different piles would be called the data training set

25
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:06.005
and the machine learning algorithm

26
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:10.002
would look for patterns in the recyclable materials.

27
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:13.004
That way could correctly label future trash

28
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:15.003
as it's coming down the belt.

29
00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:19.003
In a sense it's learning what's recyclable.

30
00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:21.006
Now, remember you need a human operator

31
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:25.003
to create those first piles of recyclable material.

32
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:29.003
So this is typically called supervised machine learning

33
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.009
and operators supervises the machine

34
00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.008
and tells the algorithms

35
00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:37.009
when they're misidentifying something as recyclable.

36
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.004
For now, this is the most popular way

37
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:44.002
that machine learning algorithms classify data.

38
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:46.001
But there's another way for these machine learning

39
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:48.006
algorithms to work with data,

40
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:52.002
it's called unsupervised machine learning.

41
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:55.006
Unsupervised machine learning doesn't classify data,

42
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:59.004
instead it works to create clusters of data.

43
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:02.000
So imagine that a human operator doesn't create

44
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.002
those first training sets,

45
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:08.000
it just asks the machine to identify patterns in the data.

46
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.006
That means that the unsupervised machine learning algorithm

47
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:15.000
would look at all the trash coming down the conveyor belt.

48
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.002
It wouldn't get those first piles

49
00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.002
sorted by recyclables in waste.

50
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:23.003
Then it would cluster the trash into different groups

51
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:26.001
that make sense to the algorithm.

52
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:27.003
There's no training set,

53
00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:30.001
so the system creates its own groups.

54
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.008
It might make piles of garbage that are all the same color,

55
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:35.006
or it might create piles of garbage

56
00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:37.008
based on the size of the material.

57
00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:39.009
It might even create piles of trash

58
00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:44.005
based on some qualities that humans can't perceive.

59
00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:46.008
As you can imagine, unsupervised learning

60
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:49.006
wouldn't be very useful for this recycling plant,

61
00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:51.000
but it might be useful for something

62
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
like a pharmaceutical company

63
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.009
or an automated stock trading system.

64
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.003
You might want to find patterns that humans

65
00:02:58.003 --> 00:03:00.003
haven't yet identified.

66
00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:03.009
It might even lead to discovery of a new drug.

67
00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.002
So if you're thinking about using supervised

68
00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:08.005
machine learning, start by identifying

69
00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:10.005
what data you'd like to classify,

70
00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:14.002
then try to gather up some massive data sets.
