00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.000
- We've talked about how we can use

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.003
natural language generation or NLG

3
00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:09.001
to create short paragraphs from different data sources.

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.002
This works well for organizations

5
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.008
that want to use text to explain data.

6
00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:15.008
And if you think about it,

7
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:17.002
there are many scenarios

8
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.006
where you might want to explain data.

9
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.008
One place where this is increasingly common

10
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:25.002
is with online customer support systems.

11
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:27.006
In fact, a lot of support centers

12
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.009
involve a customer service representative

13
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.005
doing a little bit of research,

14
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:34.000
and then sending back text.

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If you have a lot of data sources,

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
then it's not too difficult to imagine an NLG system

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.005
doing this heavy lifting.

18
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:43.007
Imagine that you just bought

19
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:46.004
a brand new flat screen television.

20
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.001
Then you go to the company's website

21
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:49.008
to figure out how to connect it

22
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.006
to some online streaming services.

23
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:54.001
Maybe you type a simple message

24
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:58.003
like how do I connect my television to Netflix?

25
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:01.003
An AI system can break that down into keywords.

26
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:03.008
So for this, they might search their database

27
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:06.008
for television and Netflix.

28
00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:09.003
The application could send back a message

29
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:12.001
that says something like, "Thank you for your message,

30
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.000
"we have a few television sets

31
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.008
"that allow you to watch Netflix.

32
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:19.007
"Do you have our latest model, the HDI?"

33
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:21.004
Even in a simple exchange,

34
00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:24.006
you have the AI system searching through a product catalog

35
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:28.004
to verify that certain television sets support Netflix.

36
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.001
It even lists out the latest model.

37
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.008
When your customer responds,

38
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:36.000
the AI system will have even more information.

39
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.006
It'll look through forums

40
00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:40.008
and may even perform a search on websites.

41
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:42.004
With each message,

42
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:45.001
the AI system has a new set of keywords

43
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:48.005
to perform a more sophisticated search.

44
00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:52.007
The more data this NLG system has access to,

45
00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:55.004
the more useful the response.

46
00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:57.007
You might get a message back that the television

47
00:01:57.007 --> 00:02:00.001
has a brand new firmware update.

48
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:01.001
Then you'll get a response

49
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:05.000
to see if you need help installing the update.

50
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.008
NLG also gives organizations an opportunity

51
00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:11.004
to reach out to customers to prevent problems.

52
00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:13.006
Remember that the NLG system

53
00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:16.007
sees communication as a data challenge.

54
00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:20.001
So now the organization has a little bit more data

55
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:22.008
about how you use your television set.

56
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.009
It knows what type of television you have

57
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:28.008
and the fact that you like to use it to watch Netflix.

58
00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:31.000
It now has all the data it needs

59
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.002
to send out messages to prevent future service issues.

60
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:37.004
Maybe Netflix changed their clients

61
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:39.008
so it no longer works with your television.

62
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:42.007
The organization could use their NLG system

63
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:44.007
to send you an email.

64
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:46.009
It might say that if you still use your television set

65
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:48.002
to watch Netflix,

66
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.007
then you might need to upgrade your firmware.

67
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:52.008
So with the help of your TV set,

68
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:57.004
you become just another data source for the NLG system.

69
00:02:57.004 --> 00:02:58.008
It can use this data

70
00:02:58.008 --> 00:03:01.007
to send you relevant customer service messages.
