00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.005
- So we've seen how to use artificial intelligence

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:05.002
to generate natural sounding text.

3
00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:08.002
Natural language generation, or NLG,

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.009
works best when the system has access

5
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.001
to many different data sources.

6
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:18.002
Generally NLG is about getting your AI system to write.

7
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.009
But as most grade school students will tell you,

8
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.006
writing is only half the equation.

9
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.004
AI systems also need to read.

10
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:30.000
This is typically called natural language understanding

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.009
or NLU.

12
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.004
Now it would be easier to talk about AI systems

13
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:35.009
as reading and writing

14
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:38.009
instead of understanding and generating.

15
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.006
But remember, even though the end result might be the same,

16
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:45.007
the AI system is doing something very different

17
00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:48.008
from what you do when you read and write.

18
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:51.009
So think about a simple conversation you might have.

19
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.001
Imagine a new Indian food restaurant

20
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.003
opened up close to where you work.

21
00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:59.006
One day, a coworker asks you a question,

22
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:03.001
did you and Susan try the new Indian food restaurant?

23
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:07.002
Then you answer back, actually it was a little too spicy.

24
00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.006
Then they ask, will you go back?

25
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:12.007
Then you say, I don't know.

26
00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:15.000
Now this conversation is pretty seamless

27
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.007
from a human perspective,

28
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:19.009
but if you look at it from the perspective of an AI system

29
00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.006
you can start to see how this gets really complicated.

30
00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:26.002
The first challenge is that you need to understand

31
00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.005
a lot of context.

32
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:30.000
When your coworker asks you

33
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.004
if you tried the new restaurant,

34
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:36.001
they're really asking if you went there for the first time.

35
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:38.007
When you responded that it was too spicy,

36
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:40.003
you're answering their question

37
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:42.009
and then adding more information.

38
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.009
You're saying whether or not you liked the food.

39
00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.000
So you wouldn't know if the food was spicy,

40
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.004
unless you went to the restaurant.

41
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:52.006
Finally, when your coworker asks

42
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:55.009
if you want to go back your answers a little irregular,

43
00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.008
you say you don't know.

44
00:01:57.008 --> 00:01:59.003
But in this case it doesn't mean

45
00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:01.009
that you don't know what they're asking.

46
00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.009
Instead, it means that you don't know

47
00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.005
whether or not the food was good enough to go back.

48
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:09.004
Remember that the AI system

49
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:12.006
is only looking at data and patterns.

50
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:14.008
That means that the system must have a lot

51
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:19.009
of underlying data to make sense of this simple exchange.

52
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:20.009
The system will need to know

53
00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:24.004
what trying a restaurant means in this context.

54
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:27.004
It will also have to know that the food being spicy

55
00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:30.000
is actually an answer to a question.

56
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.007
Then it has to know that you not knowing

57
00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:35.005
whether you'll go back is actually your judgment

58
00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.004
about the quality of the restaurant.

59
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:40.009
It's not that you don't know what your coworker's asking.

60
00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.005
If the AI system didn't understand your meaning

61
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:45.001
when you said, don't know,

62
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:46.009
it might have responded with something like,

63
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.002
would you like me to repeat the question?

64
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.005
Because it might incorrectly assume

65
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:54.007
that you didn't know what the person was asking.

66
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:58.008
In many ways, NLU is really the most challenging component

67
00:02:58.008 --> 00:03:00.008
of natural language processing.

68
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:02.003
That's because it's very difficult

69
00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:04.009
to have a conversation with an AI system

70
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.009
if they don't first understand what you're saying.
