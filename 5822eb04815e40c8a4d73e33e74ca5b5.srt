00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.003
- Remember that automated decision making systems work best

2
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:07.004
when they have access to massive amounts of data.

3
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.006
That's how they make the best analytical decisions.

4
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:13.001
These systems rely on other technologies

5
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.004
to gather up that data.

6
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:18.005
Now these automated decision systems can use data

7
00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:20.004
from many different sources.

8
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:22.005
This might include past data

9
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.000
but it can also include current data

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or data that's created in real time.

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.009
That's why you're seeing some organizations use IoT devices

12
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.006
to gather up data for these decision making systems.

13
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:38.007
IoT stands for Internet of things.

14
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:40.008
It usually refers small devices

15
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.001
that are connected to the internet.

16
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.000
The whole point of these devices

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.002
is to create real time data.

18
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.002
State electric companies are one

19
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:52.003
of the organizations doing interesting work

20
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.005
using IoT devices.

21
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.001
They connect these devices

22
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:59.002
to their automated decision making systems.

23
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:02.001
These companies put small communication devices

24
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:03.009
into your electric meter.

25
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.005
That way they can process your electricity use

26
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:07.008
in real time.

27
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:09.004
They record this data and try

28
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:12.001
to predict when you need more power.

29
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.007
They can gather this data for groups of houses,

30
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:17.001
cities, and even states.

31
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.007
They can then use it for statistical analysis

32
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:23.000
on statewide energy usage.

33
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.006
These companies use this data

34
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.000
in automated decision making systems

35
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.002
to try and create next generation smart grids.

36
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:35.007
An AI system can see very complex patterns on energy usage.

37
00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:38.002
So these AI systems can route more power

38
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:42.001
to different parts of the grid in real time.

39
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.008
That way they make sure customers get the power they need.

40
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:49.002
But the AI system could also make decisions as well.

41
00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:51.009
It could determine if customers are too wasteful.

42
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.007
Then the system might raise the rate

43
00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:55.007
for that individual to encourage them

44
00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:58.009
to increase their energy efficiency.

45
00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.004
Newer IoT meters can even identify individual appliances

46
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:04.009
in someone's house.

47
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.000
At some point,

48
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.001
they might even be able to shut off outlets

49
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:11.003
if they detect an appliance is shorting out.

50
00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:13.005
This stream of real time data combined

51
00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:16.002
with AI decision making could create a system

52
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.003
that sees large scale patterns

53
00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:21.009
while also keeping track of each outlet.

54
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.008
So if you're thinking about using this tool,

55
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:27.005
you might want to think carefully about what real time data

56
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:31.003
would be the most useful in your decision making.

57
00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:33.007
Remember that AI systems do best

58
00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:36.001
with massive amounts of data.

59
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.007
They're great at making analytical decisions

60
00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:41.005
that don't require a lot of creativity.

61
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:43.001
The more data you collect,

62
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:45.008
the more powerful your system becomes.

63
00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:48.005
If you decide to use IoT devices,

64
00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:50.001
be sure to look for ways

65
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:53.006
to connect data sources to past trends.

66
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.002
It's not enough to see the data in real time.

67
00:02:56.002 --> 00:02:58.007
Your AI decision making system needs

68
00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:03.000
to compare this real time data to historical trends.

69
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
As always,

70
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.008
the quality of your data will let your system make

71
00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:10.002
much more significant automated decisions.
