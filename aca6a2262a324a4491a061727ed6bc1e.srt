00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.000
- I hope you've enjoyed this course

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
on artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.008
Throughout the course,

4
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:08.000
we covered some very high level AI concepts.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.007
You've seen how machine learning

6
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:12.009
and artificial neural networks can help you see patterns

7
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.009
in massive datasets.

8
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.009
You've also seen how biometrics and natural language

9
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.009
can be broken down into regular data.

10
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.004
Once these AI systems can use this data,

11
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.006
it becomes just another form of pattern matching.

12
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.006
So that means you can create AI systems

13
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.003
that can read and write texts,

14
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:31.007
predict your behavior,

15
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:34.003
or identify you in a crowd.

16
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:35.005
Now that you've taken this course,

17
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:37.002
there's actually a few different ways

18
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:40.000
you can continue to learn about AI.

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.001
You can start to drill down into specific tools

20
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.005
so you can learn more about something

21
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:47.009
like natural language processing with Python.

22
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:50.005
But you could also choose to take a deeper dive

23
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.001
into any of the AI concepts.

24
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.006
There are plenty of courses on machine learning,

25
00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:56.005
deep learning,

26
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.000
and artificial neural networks.

27
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.005
These AI tools continue to improve and evolve,

28
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.002
so please feel free to follow me on LinkedIn.

29
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.007
Here, I'll post about interesting new things

30
00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:10.004
in the world of AI.

31
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:12.003
Thank you for watching this course.

32
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:14.004
I hope you continue learning about

33
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:16.005
this fascinating technology.

34
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:18.000
Then you can find creative ways

35
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.001
to explore and use artificial intelligence.
