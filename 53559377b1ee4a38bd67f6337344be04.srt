00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.007
- There are many cases

2
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:05.005
where you'd need a very specialized decision-making system.

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.006
You'd certainly want a specialized system

4
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:11.003
to evaluate X-rays, but there are also many times

5
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.005
where you'd use a more general form of decision-making.

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.006
We've seen this happening with banks and credit cards.

7
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.002
You've probably seen those websites

8
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:23.005
that promise a 30-second decision for a loan or credit card.

9
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.007
These websites typically use a form

10
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:27.009
of automated decision-making.

11
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.005
They'll look at your credit score,

12
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:33.002
and if you meet a certain criteria, you'll get approved.

13
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:36.003
Newer machine learning algorithms allow you to do this

14
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:38.008
in a much more sophisticated way.

15
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:41.007
These automated decision-making systems aren't limited

16
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.005
to a simple credit score.

17
00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:45.003
Instead, these newer systems can look

18
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.002
at your employment history, your job history,

19
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.004
and even your social media data.

20
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:52.008
Because they're looking through so much more data,

21
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:56.004
they can usually make a much more accurate decision.

22
00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:58.009
And machine learning can make accurate predictions

23
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:01.004
at a much lower cost.

24
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:03.003
In the past, you'd have a loan agent

25
00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:05.005
and a lengthy application process.

26
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:08.003
The whole point of this process was to try and predict

27
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:10.009
whether you'd have trouble paying back a loan.

28
00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.003
So the cost of deciding whether

29
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:15.007
to give you a loan was relatively high.

30
00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:18.005
Now these newer systems can make a much more accurate

31
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:21.003
and less costly decision in seconds.

32
00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:24.003
And since these systems give more accurate results

33
00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:26.009
at a lower cost, they're now being used

34
00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.008
for many different types of decisions.

35
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:33.002
Some businesses are using automated decision-making systems

36
00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:36.004
to decide whether or not they should hire a new employee.

37
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:39.000
Some universities use similar systems

38
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.001
to decide whether they should admit a student.

39
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.000
If you're thinking about using a system like this

40
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.002
with your organization, then start by considering your data.

41
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:51.006
The most common system is one that classifies people

42
00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.005
into certain groups.

43
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:54.004
Remember that many

44
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:56.009
of these automated decision-making systems

45
00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.008
use supervised machine learning.

46
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:04.001
So you might classify people as high-risk loan candidates.

47
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:06.006
Remember that with supervised machine learning,

48
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:09.004
you start out by creating a small training set

49
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:13.004
to show the system how you want to classify the data.

50
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:16.005
In this case, you'll show the system how to classify people

51
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.009
into different risk groups.

52
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:20.004
So if you work for a bank,

53
00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:23.003
you'd create a training set of applications

54
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:26.005
for people who didn't repay their loans.

55
00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:30.003
Those would be your high risk loan candidates.

56
00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:32.008
If you want to create a system that hires people,

57
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:34.008
then you'd want to create a training set

58
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:38.008
of employment applications for your most successful hires.

59
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:41.004
Then you'd train the system to look for people

60
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:43.005
with similar qualities.

61
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:45.000
You'd feed the data into the system

62
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
so it can look for patterns.

63
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.009
The system will find patterns

64
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.004
in some of your high-risk loan candidates,

65
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.000
or it will look for patterns

66
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.007
in some of your most successful employees.

67
00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:59.006
Then it will match those patterns to the new applications.
