00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.001
- The real power of artificial neural networks

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.002
is their ability to supercharge machine learning.

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.001
In fact,

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.003
there's actually a relationship between the size

5
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:13.003
of the network and how well the system sees patterns.

6
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:15.006
Remember that artificial neural networks

7
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:17.008
have layers of neurons.

8
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:20.009
There's the input layer, the output layer,

9
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.002
and then the layers in between.

10
00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.001
These layers in between

11
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:28.006
are typically called the hidden layers.

12
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.004
Some systems have many hidden layers

13
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.001
and this is usually called

14
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.005
a deep learning artificial neural network.

15
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:40.001
That's because the network is many layers deep.

16
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.008
Companies like Google have really embraced

17
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.006
deep learning artificial neural networks.

18
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:49.000
They use them to look for complex patterns.

19
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.003
You may have heard that Google

20
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:52.004
used their deep learning network

21
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:56.001
to teach a machine learning system how to play video games.

22
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:58.008
The system observed many hours of gameplay

23
00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:02.005
and then looked for patterns on how to win the game.

24
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.009
Later, they used that same technology

25
00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.007
to teach the system how to play

26
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:10.001
an ancient Chinese game called Go.

27
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.001
Go is thought to be so complex

28
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.009
that there is many variations in games

29
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.008
as there are atoms in the universe.

30
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:20.002
So clearly that's a lot of data.

31
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:21.000
At first,

32
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.008
the deep learning network observed thousands

33
00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:25.008
of experts playing the game.

34
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:27.000
Then after awhile,

35
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.003
they programmed the system to play against itself.

36
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:33.001
It was able to discover many of the different patterns

37
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.005
that led to winning the game.

38
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:37.000
So you might be wondering why a company

39
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.008
like Google would spend so much time figuring out

40
00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:42.000
how to play an ancient game.

41
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.004
The reason is that Google is using the same technology

42
00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:48.009
to better understand their users' behavior.

43
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.004
So think of it this way.

44
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:54.000
If Google can use this system to master such a complex game,

45
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.003
then it's actually pretty easy to predict

46
00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:58.006
whether you're going to buy a new car.

47
00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:02.005
It uses the same underlying technology.

48
00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:04.006
Earlier, we talked about how machine learning

49
00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:07.001
can help you make better predictions.

50
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:10.002
If Google can predict with 95% certainty

51
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:11.006
that you'll buy a product,

52
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.005
then that has an incredible commercial value.

53
00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:16.007
So if you're thinking about applying this technology

54
00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:18.002
in your organization,

55
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:20.003
you have to consider a few things.

56
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:22.000
It's actually not difficult

57
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to create an artificial neural network.

58
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.006
There's even a few free tools

59
00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.005
that you'll see later in the course.

60
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:29.008
But what is difficult is getting the type

61
00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:33.005
of data you'll need to fine tune your deep learning.

62
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:37.002
Now Google easily has access to petabytes of user data

63
00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:40.003
but what type of data does your organization have?

64
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:43.005
What type of behavior would you like to predict?

65
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:46.003
Some of the best places to look are the parts

66
00:02:46.003 --> 00:02:49.004
of your organization that run on gut level instinct.

67
00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:50.007
If you have the right data,

68
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:52.009
then you might find that some of these systems

69
00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.009
actually do a better job predicting than even some

70
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.006
of your most experienced employees.
